# hello-world
My first project on GitHub
Hi, little silly newbies and great old wise professionals. I'm Artyom.
I have a little experience in C and Java. And my job links with mathematical programs in Matlab.
But coding is not my single talent, I'm also a poet. And I have a lot other fanatic hobbies.
